<p><strong>3. Our Amenities:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cashback Service:</strong></p>

<p>This service of CashKarle allows our registered users ("Members") to avail the services of cashback covered purchases from retail merchants on the Site ("Retailers"). To qualify for cashback, the Retail merchant has to confirm that the purchase made by registered member is followed, it is genuine and successful (constituting a "Qualifying Transaction"), and your resulting cashback must be received by us (becoming "Cashback" as a result).</p>

<p>In the event that the Retailers do no track a transaction using their affiliate tracking system, then such sales might not be paid to CashKarle, and hence any due or expected cashback from these sales will also not be paid to the Member. </p>

<p><strong>Unique Referral Fee:</strong></p>
<p>The CashKarle.com Service also provides a unique and ingenious referral fees to its Members where the Members get ten per cent cashback on each new Member's Cashback introduced by them in the manner provided on the Site ("Qualifying Referral") as long as they remain a Member themselves. Please see Clause 5 below for details.</p>
	
<p><strong>4. Method of cashback earning</strong></p>

<p>After a Member successfully completes a Qualifying Transaction, and once we have received the resulting Cashback for that Qualifying Transaction, we pass that Cashback to the Member through his/her Cashback Receipt Method.</p>

<p>Please note that there are various circumstances in which a transaction with a Retailer may not constitute a Qualifying Transaction, or Cashback may not result from it. This is also true for a Qualifying Referral. The Member understands that all transactions made by him/her are not with us, but with the individual Retailer. Our help pages provide further information about these circumstances. Further, from time to time Retailers may increase or decrease the commission paid – in which case the cashback offer illustrated on our Site may be incorrect. By default, your applicable transactions will be credited in line with the commission reported to us by the Retailer, which may be more or less than the advertised rate. We shall not be liable for any difference in the expected cashback by the Member and the actual Cashback received by the Member.</p>

<p>When we have traced a paying, Qualifying Transaction to your Account, we will credit your Account with a 'pending payment'. Once the Retailer confirms the transaction, the payment will be marked as 'validated' – this can take 90 days or more from the date of the purchase. If the goods are returned or the sale reversed or amended by any means then the cashback payment will not be made. Further, in the event that the Retailer feels that the purchase is not genuine for any reason whatsoever and we do not receive any Cashback for the transaction, the Member will not receive any Cashback.</p>

<p>Whether a transaction shall qualify as a Qualifying for cashback Transaction (including cashback through a Qualifying Referral) shall be at the sole discretion of the Retailer or us and the Member understands and agrees to the same. We shall not be held responsible if the Retailer fails to report a sale to us or does not qualify a transaction as Qualifying Transaction. Further, we shall not be responsible in the event due to some technical or other error we cannot trace a sale back to the Member and does not qualify the transaction as a Qualifying Transaction or a Qualifying Referral for any reason whatsoever. Whilst we will endeavour to recuperate non-payments from the Retailer, the decision of ourselves, the Retailer or Retailer's tracking agent is final. Whilst we will try and recuperate missing commissions, at any point we reserve the right not to chase missing commission claims, particularly where no purchase has been made.</p>

<p>When a Member sends us an enquiry on missing cashback, our system would check if the user had an exit click from our site for that store on the date mentioned by the user. If no exit clicks can be tracked then we will show a message to the Member indicating that they did not click via our website to earn cashback prior to the sale. All exit clicks to stores are saved in the database for cross reference on adding cashback values. Where a commission enquiry has been successfully paid by a Retailer, you may receive a lower amount than expected; this is due to the amounts received by ourselves possibly being lower than the original claim. We do allow you to query this with us. If a Retailer still hasn't paid a manual commission claim after a period of six months then we reserve the right to close the enquiry claim. All payment for Missing Cashback is only applicable in instances where the Retailer pays the Company.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to reclaim or make balance adjustments accordingly where it has been established that any credit has been applied in error. This will include but is not limited to transactions where the credit is not genuinely due or payment for any credited transaction has not been received from a Retailer or its agencies and/or misuse or fraud. This can include transactions which are already marked as payable or validated in your Account, or for transactions which have already been paid over to you by [NEFT or Cheque] or any other means.</p>

<p>There are various circumstances in which Cashback will not be payable to the Member, and will be forfeited to us, these could be, without limitation:</p>
<p>a.	where the cashback payment that we receive is not attributed to a Qualifying Transaction or associated with an Account (such as where the Member is not logged-in to the our site when making the relevant purchase)</p>
<p>b.	the transaction to which the Cashback relates is cancelled after it has been entered into (whether under the right of cancellation that applies to some sales made at a distance, or otherwise) the Cashback is attributed to a Member or Account that has been:</p>
<p>i.	suspended by us under Clause 9 of this Agreement or for any other reason;</p>
<p>ii.	associated with any fraudulent activity or any breach of this Agreement;</p>

<p><strong>5. Operation of our Cashback Service:</strong></p>

<p>We reserve the right to withdraw, modify or suspend aspects of the Cashback Service, or the entirety of it, where we have legal, security, technical or commercial reasons to do so. We will endeavor to give you 30 days advance notice before taking such action, except where it is necessary to take earlier action for security reasons or because of technical difficulties which would otherwise adversely affect the our service. There may also be times when the Cashback Service becomes inaccessible as a result of technical difficulties experienced by us or on the Internet; we will, however, use reasonable skill and care to overcome these difficulties where they are within our control. Please note, however, that we cannot guarantee continuous access to the Cashback Service or any of the content that appears on it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we will strive to ensure that any periods of planned unavailability, which you will be informed of when you access the Cashback Service at the relevant time, are kept to a minimum.</p>

<p>For security or other reasons, we may require you to change password or other information which facilitates access to the Cashback Service; however, we will never ask you for your password via email, telephone, or any other means other than through the Site. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and any additional identifying information.</p>

<p>As a CashKarle member you can avail Cashback or a cash reward for making a purchase from various retailers listed on CashKarle.com. However, CashKarle can only provide cashback on genuine transactions which are successfully tracked and verified by the retailers. Once your transaction is successfully tracked and verified by the retailer, we get a commission form the retailer and we pass on this commision in the form of cashback onto you. </p>

<p>Please take into account that under certain conditions, your transaction may not get tracked or qualify for a cashback. Under any circumstances, we cannot be held responsible for the same. Retailers deem a transaction to be genuine or valid through their own set of rules. A transaction deemed as non-genuine or invalid by the retailer would not qualify for a cashback. For more information regarding these conditions, please refer to our FAQs pages. </p>

<p>CashKarle would always make the best efforts on its part to recover non payments and missing cashback from the retailers. In case, you made a genuine transaction and did not receive a cashback, you can make a claim by contacting our support. However, we reserve the right to stop chasing your cashback claim at any point and our decision will be final in this regard. </p>

<p>At times you may receive a lower amount in cashback than what you were expecting. This happens when retailer gives us an amount less than his original claim. In this case, you may raise a query and we would take it up with the retailer. Though, we reserve the right to close this enquiry claim if the retailer still does not pays in a period of six months. </p>

<p>Cashback may also be forfeited by CashKarle under the following circumstances :</p>
<p>a. In case the user is not logged in while transacting through CashKarle and we receive an unattributed cashback payment which is not associated with any user account.</p>
<p>b. In case the cashback is attributed to an account which is terminated by CashKarle under Clause 3 or 10.</p>

<p><strong>6. Your Account:</strong></p>

<p>You can withdraw your validated cashback when you have at least Rs 150 in your Account. In the event the Member decides to close the Account with us or the Member's Account is closed for any reason whatsoever, before reaching the initial Rs 150 limit, there mind be a small transaction fee to withdraw the cashback. Cashback payments by Cheque carry an additional fee of Rs 30. This is charged by our Bank to cover administration and postage costs. We have the discretion to forfeit any such validated balance showing on your Account for the reasons provided elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>
